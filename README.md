 # Encryption and Decryption Project

This repository showcases implementations of various encryption and decryption techniques. It is divided into three main tasks: Affine, Monoalphabetic, and Polyalphabetic ciphers (Task 1), DES encryption (Task 2), and OpenSSL encryption (Task 3).

## Introduction

This project is designed to explore different encryption and decryption techniques for both English and Turkish alphabets. It includes:
- Implementation of Affine, Monoalphabetic, and Polyalphabetic ciphers.
- Brute force and analysis-based decryption methods.
- A detailed DES (Data Encryption Standard) implementation.
- Sample usage of OpenSSL for encryption.

## File Structure

The project is divided into three main sections:
- **ap-mo-po/**: Contains Python scripts for Task 1 (Affine, Monoalphabetic, and Polyalphabetic ciphers).
- **des/**: Contains the implementation of DES encryption and decryption.
- **openssl/**: Contains the output of OpenSSL encryption and decryption.
