# Encryption and Decryption Project

This project is a Python application that includes various encryption and decryption methods. You can test different encryption processes by running the files below.

## Files and Execution Instructions

- **Affine Cipher Brute Force Test**: Run `run_affine_hacking.py` to test hacking with Affine Brute Force.
- **Affine Cipher Brute Force Turkish Test**: Run `run_affine_tr_hacking.py` to test hacking with Affine Brute Force.

- **Polyalphabetic Cipher Brute Force Test**: Run `run_poly_hacking.py` to test hacking with Polyalphabetic Brute Force.
- **Polyalphabetic Cipher Force Turkish Test**: Run `run_poly_tr_hacking.py` to test hacking with Polyalphabetic Brute Force.

- **Monoalphabetic Cipher Analysis**: Run `run_mono_hacking.py` to perform hacking with the Analysis Technique.
------------------------------------------------------------
- **Run 'run.py' to perform all the methods below with both the English and Turkish alphabets.**
